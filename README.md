I made Portal 2's Hammer open like it should.
Apparently someone at Valve forgot to disable the Perforce connections to Hammer and that's why you're required to open Hammer from Steam.
Fixed that for PUNT, thought ya'll might like to have it.
If you're into this sort of thing, check out [BUMRad](https://bumrad.gmdianaty.com)

2) Double click Hammer.
